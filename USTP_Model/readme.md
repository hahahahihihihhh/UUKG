#  Knowledge-enhanced Urban SpatioTemporal Prediction 

This code is the official PyTorch implementation of [UUKG: Unified Urban Knowledge Graph Dataset for Urban Spatiotemporal Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.11443.pdf) as well as multiple spatiotemporal prediction models which can be trained for the urban spatiotemporal downstream tasks. 

## Installation

Create a python 3.7 environment and install dependencies:

```bash
conda create -n libcity python=3.7
conda activate libcity
conda install pytorch==1.13.0 torchvision==0.14.0 torchaudio==0.13.0 pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
cd ./USTP_Model
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Directory Structure

- |-raw_data/:    Store preprocessed atomic files.
- |-libcity/:    Project code root directory.
  - |-config/:   The ConfigParser class is defined here, which supports command line and config file to modify our default parameters. 
  - |-data/:   The Dataset class is stored in a subfolder of this folder according to different tasks. 
  - |-model/:    Model classes are stored in subfolders of this folder according to the tasks they belong to. 
  - |-evaluator/:    A task corresponds to a dedicated evaluator.
  - |-executor/:    Each task provides a standard Executor, and the model can also have its own exclusive Executor.
  - |-pipeline/:     Store user-oriented pipeline functions, which are responsible for running through the entire framework process.
  - |cache/:    Store the cache. Specifically, data preprocessing results, model training results, and evaluation results will be cached.
  - |-tmp/:    Store temporary files such as checkpoint generated during training.
  - |-utils/:    Store some general utility functions.
- |-logs/:    Store log information during training.

The directory structure could help readers better understand our code framework.


## Datasets

The complete datasets could be found in  [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1egTmnKRzTQuyW_hsbFURUonGC-bJmBHW?usp=sharing), then you should put them under the folder **./raw_data**.

The following types of atomic files are defined:

| filename    | content                                  | example                                  |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| xxx.geo     | Store geographic entity attribute information. | geo_id, type, coordinates                |
| xxx.rel     | Store the relationship information between entities, such as areas. | rel_id, type, origin_id, destination_id  |
| xxx.dyna    | Store traffic condition information.     | dyna_id, type, time, entity_id, location_id |
| config.json | Used to supplement the description of the above table information. |                                          |

we explain the above four atomic files as follows:

**xxx.geo**: An element in the Geo table consists of the following four parts:

**geo_id, type, coordinates.**

```
geo_id: The primary key uniquely determines a geo entity.
type: The type of geo. These three values are consistent with the points, lines and planes in Geojson.
coordinates: Array or nested array composed of float type. Describe the location information of the geo entity, using the coordinates format of Geojson.
```

**xxx.rel**: An element in the Rel table consists of the following four parts:

**rel_id, type, origin_id, destination_id.**

```
rel_id: The primary key uniquely determines the relationship between entities.
type: The type of rel. Range in [usr, geo], which indicates whether the relationship is based on geo or usr.
origin_id: The ID of the origin of the relationship, which is either in the Geo table or in the Usr table.
destination_id: The ID of the destination of the relationship, which is one of the Geo table or the Usr table.
```

**xxx.dyna**: An element in the Dyna table consists of the following five parts:

**dyna_id, type, time, entity_id(multiple columns**.

```
dyna_id: The primary key uniquely determines a record in the Dyna table.
type: The type of dyna. There are two values: label (for event-based task) and state (for traffic state prediction task).
time: Time information, using the date and time combination notation in ISO-8601 standard, such as: 2020-12-07T02:59:46Z.
entity_id: Describe which entity the record is based on, which is the ID of geo or usr.
```

**xxx.config**: The config file is used to supplement the information describing the above five tables themselves. It is stored in `json` format and consists of six keys: `geo`, `usr`, `rel`, `dyna`, `ext`, and `info`.

## Quick to Usage

```bash
nohup python run.py > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```
The script `run.py` used for training and evaluating a single model is provided in the root directory of the framework, and a series of command line parameters are provided to allow users to adjust the running parameter configuration.
When run the `run.py`, you must specify the following three parameters, namely `task`, `dataset` and `model`.

If you want to kill it
```bash
kill -9 PID
```

**How to fuse UrbanKG embedding?**

To fuse UrbanKG embedding, we directly concatenate the embedding with USTP feature for input. You can mannualy modify it in the **./data/dataset/traffic_state_dataset.py**.

## Create your own dataset

We support adding new spatiotemporal flow prediction and spatiotemporal event prediction datasets. You can build your own datasets based on existing datasets format in **./raw_data** and evaluate different methods under our framework.
